 * Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in place.
 * <p>
 * click to show follow up.

 * Follow up:
 * Did you use extra space?
 * A straight forward solution using O(m n) space is probably a bad idea.
 * A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
 * Could you devise a constant space solution?
